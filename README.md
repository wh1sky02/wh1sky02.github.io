👋 Hi, I’m @wh1sky02  
👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity, penetration testing, CTF challenges, and building tools that enhance digital privacy and security.  
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced threat detection, malware analysis, and stealth VPN/proxy technologies.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source cybersecurity projects, automation tools for ethical hacking, and privacy-focused software.
